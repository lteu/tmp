07:14:44.467 [main] WARN  c.u.c.b.s.c.SequentialModelBasedAlgorithmConfiguration - Configuration 69 (0x2A9B55D) which has been selected to replace the current incumbent 801 (0x159A6B6) has 2 early censored runs. Future versions of SMAC will handle this case properly. For now we will simply repair the invariant manually by running all capped runs up to kappaMax. This warning can be safely ignored, it exists only so that this condition has some visibility (as SMAC could be improved by fixing this)
